					Summary today

	Today,I learn the four components of the ContentProvider.If you use the ContentProvider,you must define a class and extend ContentProvider.You also should add receiver in
AndroidManifest.Next,we can use ContentResolver to get the data which ContentProvider provides.Using ContentProvider can help us to operate the database in phone such as inserting,deleting,updating and selecting.
	I make two programmes about reading phone's message and contacts.
